### Example: 7-night Caribbean vacation

- Resort fees: $45/night × 7 = $315
- Annual membership: $199
- **Total: $1,410**

These aren't fake rates or bait-and-switch promotions. These are actual wholesale prices verified across 50 luxury properties in February 2025.

The difference between paying retail and paying wholesale isn't about the room you get—it's about the distribution channel you use to book it.

**The question isn't whether these rates exist. The question is: how many more vacations will you take once you start accessing them?**

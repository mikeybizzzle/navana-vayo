## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Required tools
- Node.js 18+ 
- Claude Code CLI
- Git
```

### Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Prepare your workspace:**
```bash
mkdir navan-replica
cd navan-replica
```

2. **Download orchestration files:**
```bash
# Place all 4 markdown files in your project root
# - CLAUDE_CODE_ORCHESTRATION.md
# - CONTEXT_TARGET_WEBSITE.md
# - TESTING_SUITE_CONFIGURATION.md
# - QUICK_REFERENCE.md
```

3. **Initialize Claude Code:**
```bash
# Start Claude Code with the orchestration prompt
claude-code --prompt "$(cat CLAUDE_CODE_ORCHESTRATION.md)"
```

4. **Watch it work:**
Claude Code will immediately:
- Launch Playwright browser

## üéì How It Works

### The Orchestration System

This system transforms Claude Code from a tool into an autonomous agent by:

1. **Clear Role Definition**
   - Senior developer with 15+ years experience
   - Complete decision-making authority
   - Mandate to work without interruption

2. **Comprehensive Context**
   - Target website specifications
   - Design system tokens
   - Quality standards
   - Smart defaults for ambiguity

3. **Structured Process**
   - 8 clear phases with objectives
   - Validation checkpoints
   - Progress tracking
   - Self-correction protocols

4. **Automated Validation**
   - Visual regression testing
   - Performance monitoring
   - Quality checks
   - Immediate feedback loops

5. **Self-Documentation**
   - Automatic progress logs
   - Decision documentation
   - Metrics tracking
   - Knowledge capture

### Key Principles

**30-Second Rule:**
Every prompt includes context, tools, and guidance needed for autonomous completion.

**Validation Frequency:**
Automatic checks every 30 minutes and after each component.

**Smart Defaults:**
Pre-defined assumptions for ambiguous situations to prevent blocking.

**Error Handling:**
Attempt 3 automatic fixes before requesting help.

**Progress Transparency:**
Continuous documentation of work, decisions, and learnings.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Claude Code stops frequently**
```markdown
Issue: Asking too many questions
Solution: Remind about full autonomy and smart defaults
Reference: CONTEXT_TARGET_WEBSITE.md for design decisions
```

**2. Visual accuracy below target**
```markdown
Issue: Replica doesn't match original
Solution: 
  - Run npm run test:visual --headed
  - Use Playwright inspector to compare
  - Extract exact CSS values from original
  - Apply corrections, revalidate
```

**3. Performance failing**
```markdown
Issue: Lighthouse scores < 90
Solution:
  - Run bundle analysis
  - Lazy load images below fold
  - Code split large components
  - Remove unused dependencies
  - Optimize images to WebP
```

**4. Tests failing repeatedly**
```markdown
Issue: Same test failing 3+ times
Solution:
  - Document specific issue
  - Note attempted fixes
  - Move to next component
  - Return to fix later with fresh perspective
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check logs:** `/docs/progress-log.md`
2. **Review test results:** `/test-results/`
3. **Read context docs:** All 4 markdown files
4. **Specific guidance:** See QUICK_REFERENCE.md
